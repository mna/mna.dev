# About me

My name is Martin Angers, I go by `mna` or some variation of it on most websites.
I'm a software developer, working mostly as a Go backend engineer since 2012. I
work remotely as a freelancer based in Quebec City, Canada. If you're interested in
my services, you can [contact me][email] - I may be available for part-time contracts.

## Background

I have been programming professionally since 1996, and for fun since I was a kid. I
have learned (and forgotten) a wide variety of languages and technologies, including:

* BASIC (probably Color BASIC, as [I had a TRS-80 Color Computer 2][coco2] way back then;
* C, which was the language used in my computer programming courses and that I still use
  and enjoy every once in a while in personal projects;
* Delphi (1.0), which I learned as an intern in 1995;
* PowerBuilder, which was used at my first professional job at DMR Consulting in 1996 (now
  Fujitsu) - I was even sent by the company to PowerSoft Conference in Los Angeles, probably
  in 1998? This was also the language used when I moved to work in Paris in 1999, at
  Paribas (now BNP-Paribas).
* Oracle Forms (?!?!), which we used extensively on a big project in 2000, I believe, at
  a small consulting firm in Quebec (now acquired by CGI).
* Visual Basic 6, and then Visual Basic .NET and C# - the whole Microsoft / .NET
  ecosystem was (and still is) huge at the government and insurance companies in Quebec.
* Node / javascript, which I still use from time to time, of course.
* Swift, which I used when I quit my job to start a (short-lived!) solo app company to build
  and sell an app in the Mac App Store. This is a great language (well, it was around
  version 3-4, haven't used it much since), but I feel it suffers from the (necessary)
  backwards compatibility requirements with Objective-C and the Apple Frameworks.
* Go, which I started learning by reading the language spec for fun during our summer
  vacation (I believe Go 1.0 was just released a few months before), and that I still use
  extensively to this day, in addition to many of my most well-known open-source projects,
  it is also the language I use the most professionally, and the one I'm most expert in.

I'm quite interested in programming languages in general (obsessed, some would say), and have
played with many relatively unknown/alpha- and beta- stages languages such as Inko, Zig,
Nit, Nim, etc. I even implemented my own toy programming language (now unmaintained), [Agora][].

# About me

{{template "post-meta.html" .Config}}

My name is Martin Angers, I go by `mna` or some variation of it on most websites.
When the `.dev` craze cooled down in March 2019, I noticed that `mna.dev` was still
available at a reasonable price, and decided that I'd make it my *portfolio* of
sorts, listing my open-source projects, blog posts and stuff.

I'm a software developer, working mostly as a Go backend engineer since 2012. I
work remotely as a freelancer based in Quebec City, Canada. If you're interested in
my services, you can [contact me][email] - I may be available for part-time contracts.

You can find some of my code on [github], [gitlab], [bitbucket] and [sourcehut], I
sometimes answer questions on [stackoverflow] and although I closed pretty much
all my "social" accounts (such as facebook, instagram, snapchat and google+ but then
so did you), I still use [twitter] from time to time. I like to read [hacker news][hn]
and [lobsters].

## Background

I have been programming professionally since 1996, and for fun since I was a kid. I
have learned (and forgotten) a wide variety of languages and technologies, including:

* BASIC (probably Color BASIC, as [I had a TRS-80 Color Computer 2][coco2] way back then;
* C, which was the language used in my computer programming courses and that I still use
  and enjoy every once in a while in personal projects;
* Delphi (1.0), which I learned as an intern in 1995;
* PowerBuilder, which was used at my first professional job at DMR Consulting in 1996 (now
  Fujitsu) - I was even sent by the company to the PowerSoft Conference in Los Angeles, probably
  in 1998? This was also the language used when I moved to Paris for work in 1999, at
  Paribas (now BNP-Paribas).
* Oracle Forms (?!?!), which we used extensively on a big project in 2000, I believe, at
  a small consulting firm in Quebec (since acquired by CGI).
* Visual Basic 6, and then Visual Basic .NET and C# - the whole Microsoft / .NET
  ecosystem was (and still is) huge at the government and insurance companies in Quebec.
* Node / javascript, which I still use from time to time, of course.
* Swift, which I used when I quit my job to start a (short-lived!) solo app company to build
  and sell an app in the Mac App Store. This is a great language (well, it was around
  version 3-4, haven't used it much since), but I feel it suffers from the (necessary)
  backwards compatibility requirements with Objective-C and the Apple Frameworks.
* Go, which I started learning by reading the language spec for fun during a summer
  vacation (I believe Go 1.0 was just released a few months before), and that I still use
  extensively to this day - in addition to many of my most well-known open-source projects,
  it is also the language I use the most professionally, and the one I'm most expert in.

I'm quite interested in programming languages in general (obsessed, some would say), and have
played with many relatively unknown/alpha- and beta- stages languages such as Inko, Zig,
Nit, Nim, etc. I even implemented my own toy programming language (now unmaintained), [Agora].

## Jobs

My career can be roughly split in 3 parts:

* Consulting in Quebec City and Paris for DMR, Planaxis, Larochelle-Gratton and CGI,
  mostly big projects for large enterprises such as Visa, BNP, government departments,
  Desjardins, etc. That was from 1996 to 2008.
* From 2008 to 2013, employed by government departments, first Revenu Québec then
  Régie de l'Assurance-Maladie du Québec in a lead software architect role.
* Since late 2013, working remotely (mostly as a freelancer, mostly for startups)
  for various companies around the world (USA, Switzerland, France, etc.).

## Personal Projects

In addition to my professional work and my open-source projects (listed on this site),
I also have various (sometimes closed-source) personal projects that were started either
for fun, to learn or experiment with new technologies, to try to generate some revenue,
or a mix of all this:

* **Horns of the Devil**, a website similar to Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes, but for
  metal reviews. I believe it was online from late 2009 to early 2011, and the only
  traces of its existence are now [on the web archive][horns]. That was built in C#,
  Javascript and SQL Server.

* **Hypermégatop, parfois**, my first blogging website (in french), focused on Node
  and Javascript. It was initially published on the blogging platform "Calepin", but
  it closed soon after and I moved it to github pages with the Jekyll static site
  generator. This was in early 2012, and my posts [over there][hyper] are linked from this
  website.

* **Provok.in**, a website where users could argue over a subject by linking articles
  or blog posts to prove their point, and vote for some point of view. It never took
  off but it was built with a very early version of Angular and I received a T-Shirt
  from them as my website was posted on their "made with Angular" website that was
  quite scarce at the time. According to [the web archive][provok], this was in 2012,
  so probably with a pre-1.0 or a newly released 1.0 of Angular. If I remember correctly,
  the backend was in Node.

* **0value.com**, my previous blogging website, custom-built using [trofaf], a very
  straightforward Go command I implemented to generate a static website from markdown
  files. It is [still live][0value] and my posts there are linked from this website.

* **Harfang Apps**, a solo company I started, selling a Redis GUI app for Mac
  via the Mac App Store. The accompanying website is [accessible via the web archive][harfang]
  and was generated using Hugo and Bulma. The app itself was a native cocoa app
  built in Swift with Xcode. It was a great learning experience, not only for the
  Swift programming language and the native Mac frameworks, but also for the huge
  amount of work required to bootstrap a company, marketing, legal aspects, app
  store requirements, etc. I took a year off to work on this, from implementation
  to launch and a few sales - too little to keep going, sadly - mainly in 2017.

## Family

My significant other and I have two wonderful kids, a boy and a girl. We also have
two cats, which you may see from time to time on my Twitter feed or on some of my
profile pictures (though usually this is *feu* Gribouille, who died in 2018).

## Hobbies

I spend a good amount of "hobby" time on programming or computer-related stuff
(see open-source and personal projects), but outside of programming and family
life, I enjoy a few hobbies:

* Listening to music - I'm a metalhead and have been since my teen years, maybe
  even before if you count Kiss and 80s "hair metal" as... well, as metal. I can
  enjoy pretty much any subgenre, but death and thrash metal is what I listen to
  the most. Outside metal, I'm also a huge Bruce Springsteen fan and I listen to
  various rock, folk and americana artists. Thanks to my kids I also listen to a
  fair share of contemporary pop and rap music.

* Making music - I play decent guitar and used to play drums, although I haven't
  played in years (I sold my drum in 2017). I have two accoustic guitars and an
  electric one (a black [B.C. Rich Warlock][bcrich]), and an old Korg keyboard.
  I recently bought an audio interface and a Shure mic, and started recording on
  GarageBand, there's a world of fun with that.

* Writing - I enjoy poetry and a few years ago I wrote a lot of it (in french),
  and had two poems published.

* Reading - I spend a lot of my reading time on technical articles and other
  programming-related documentation, but I also enjoy reading novels. Nancy
  Huston's "Lignes de faille" (*Fault lines*) and Mathias Enard's "Zone" are
  among my favorite ones.

# About me

{{template "post-meta.html" .Config}}

My name is Martin Angers (that's pronounced like the [French city of the same name][ville]).
I go by `mna` or some variation of it on most websites.
When the `.dev` craze cooled down in March 2019, I noticed that `mna.dev` was still
available at a reasonable price, and decided that I'd make it my *portfolio* of
sorts, listing my open-source projects, blog posts and stuff.

I've been a professional software developer since the mid 90s, working mostly as a Go
backend engineer since 2013. I work remotely as a freelancer based in Quebec City, Canada.
If you're interested in my services, you can [contact me][email] - I may be available for
part-time contracts.

You can find some of my code on [github], [sourcehut], [gitlab] and [bitbucket], I
sometimes answer questions on [stackoverflow] and although I closed pretty much
all my "social" accounts (such as facebook, instagram, snapchat and google+ but then
so did you), I'm trying out [mastodon] and [bluesky]. I like to read [hacker news][hn]
and [lobsters] though I rarely comment.

## Background

As mentioned earlier, I have been programming professionally since 1996, and for fun
since I was a kid. I have learned (and forgotten) a wide variety of languages and
technologies, including:

* BASIC (probably Color BASIC, as [I had a TRS-80 Color Computer 2][coco2] way back then);
* C, which was the language used in my computer programming courses and that I still use
  and enjoy every once in a while in personal projects;
* Delphi (1.0), which I learned as an intern in 1995;
* PowerBuilder, which was used at my first professional job at DMR Consulting in 1996 (now
  Fujitsu) - I was even sent by the company to the PowerSoft Conference in Los Angeles, probably
  in 1998? This was also the language used when I moved to Paris for work in 1999, at
  Paribas (now BNP-Paribas).
* Oracle Forms (?!?!), which we used extensively on a big project in 2000, I believe, at
  a small consulting firm in Quebec (since acquired by CGI).
* Visual Basic 6, and then Visual Basic .NET and C# - the whole Microsoft / .NET
  ecosystem was (and still is) huge at the government and insurance companies in Quebec.
* Node / javascript, which I still use from time to time, of course.
* Swift, which I used when I quit my job to start a (short-lived!) solo company to build
  and sell an app in the Mac App Store. This is a great language (well, it was around
  versions 3-4, haven't used it much since), but I feel it suffers from the (necessary)
  backwards compatibility requirements with Objective-C and the Apple Frameworks.
* Go, which I started learning by reading the language spec for fun during a summer
  vacation (I believe Go 1.0 was just released a few months before), and that I still use
  extensively to this day - in addition to many of my most well-known open-source projects,
  it is also the language I use the most professionally, and the one I'm now most expert in.
* Lua, which I started exploring [during the 2020 lockdown][lua] and have been using a lot for
  personal projects since.


I'm quite interested in programming languages in general (obsessed, some would say), and have
played with many relatively unknown/alpha- and beta- stages languages such as Inko, Zig,
Nit, Nim, etc. I even implemented my own toy programming language (now unmaintained), [Agora].

## Jobs

My career can be roughly split in 3 parts:

* Consulting in Quebec City and Paris for DMR, Planaxis, Larochelle-Gratton and CGI,
  mostly big projects for large enterprises such as Visa, Paribas, government departments,
  Desjardins, etc. That was from 1996 to 2008.
* From 2008 to 2013, employed by government departments, first Revenu Québec then
  Régie de l'Assurance-Maladie du Québec in a lead software architect role.
* Since late 2013, working remotely (mostly as a freelancer, mostly for startups)
  for various companies around the world (USA, Switzerland, France, etc.).

As a freelancer, I've most notably worked with [Splice](https://splice.com) to
help build the backend for roughly 6 years (in 2 stints) - including in [the
very early days](https://twitter.com/mattetti/status/1108404063375220736) when
the engineering team was very small -, multiple contracts with
[Kite](https://www.kite.com/) over 4 years working on programming language
parsers, and since mid-2021 with [Fleet](https://fleetdm.com/).

## Personal Projects

In addition to my professional work and my open-source projects (listed on this site),
I also have various (sometimes closed-source) personal projects that were started either
for fun, to learn or experiment with new technologies, to try to generate some revenue,
or a mix of all this:

* **Horns of the Devil**, a website similar to Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes, but for
  metal reviews. I believe it was online from late 2009 to early 2011, and the only
  traces of its existence are now [on the web archive][horns]. That was built in C#,
  Javascript and SQL Server.

* **Hypermégatop, parfois**, my first blogging website (in french), focused on Node
  and Javascript. It was initially published on the blogging platform "Calepin", but
  it closed soon after and I moved it to github pages with the Jekyll static site
  generator. This was in early 2012, and my posts [over there][hyper] are linked from this
  website.

* **Provok.in**, a website where users could argue over a subject by linking articles
  or blog posts to prove their point, and vote for some point of view. It never took
  off but it was built with a very early version of Angular and I received a T-Shirt
  from them as my website was posted on their "made with Angular" website that was
  quite scarce at the time. According to [the web archive][provok], this was in 2012,
  so probably with a pre-1.0 or a newly released 1.0 of Angular. If I remember correctly,
  the backend was in Node.

* **0value.com**, my previous blogging website, custom-built using [trofaf], a very
  straightforward Go command I implemented to generate a static website from markdown
  files. It is [still live][0value] and my posts there are linked from this website.

* **Harfang Apps**, a solo company I started, selling a Redis GUI app for Mac
  via the Mac App Store. The accompanying website is [accessible via the web archive][harfang]
  and was generated using Hugo and Bulma. The app itself was a native cocoa app
  built in Swift with Xcode. It was a great learning experience, not only for the
  Swift programming language and the native Mac frameworks, but also for the huge
  amount of work required to bootstrap a company, marketing, legal aspects, app
  store requirements, etc. I took a year off to work on this, from implementation
  to launch and a few sales - too little to keep going, sadly - mainly in 2017.

* [**Fiends.io**][fiends], a search engine for heavy metal reviews launched in
  early 2021, scratching a similar itch as the previously mentioned Horns of
  the Devil website. This is implemented following the architecture and
  development philosophy outlined in my [Small is Beautiful][small] blog post.
  I shut it down in mid-2022 as I did not use it much anymore and it did not
  see a lot of traffic.

## Family

My significant other and I have two wonderful ~~kids~~ ~~teenagers~~ young adults, a boy and a
girl. We also have [two
cats](https://twitter.com/___mna___/status/1247589958954749954), which you may
see from time to time on my social feeds or on some of my profile pictures
(though usually this is *feu* Gribouille, who died in 2018).

## Hobbies

I spend a good amount of "hobby" time on programming or computer-related stuff
(see open-source and personal projects), but outside of programming and family
life, I enjoy a few hobbies:

* Listening to music - I'm a metalhead and have been since my teen years, maybe
  even before if you count Kiss and 80s "hair metal" as... well, as metal. I can
  enjoy pretty much any subgenre, but death and thrash metal is what I listen to
  the most. Outside metal, I'm also a huge Bruce Springsteen fan and I listen to
  various rock, folk and americana artists. Thanks to my kids I also listen to a
  fair share of contemporary pop and rap music.

* Making music - I play [decent
  guitar](https://twitter.com/___mna___/status/1286394098916757511) and used to
  play drums, although I haven't played in years (I sold my drum in 2017). I
  have two accoustic guitars and two electric ones (including a black [B.C. Rich
  Warlock][bcrich]), and an old Korg keyboard. I have an audio interface and a
  Shure mic, and sometimes record stuff on GarageBand, there's a world of fun
  with that.

* Writing - I enjoy poetry and some years ago I wrote a lot of it (in french),
  and had two poems published.

* Reading - I spend a lot of my reading time on technical articles and other
  programming-related documentation, but I also enjoy reading novels, history
  books and fantasy. Nancy Huston's "Lignes de faille" (*Fault lines*) and 
  Mathias Enard's "Zone" are among my favorite ones.

* DIY Projects - I built a
  [catio](https://twitter.com/___mna___/status/1406756511322447879) for our
  cats, and more recently [a shed all by
  myself](https://twitter.com/___mna___/status/1542282756142637057), and another one
  a couple years later. I'm now doing a lot of woodworking projects for fun, mostly small furniture.
